# iam-py-test's allowlist
An allowlist of known legitimate domains

- allowlist.txt

Domains to be allowed. Subdomains are not allowed unless listed.
- trackers.txt

Domains used entirely/mostly for tracking or ads (services harmful to privacy - such as Google Search - are not included). Only to be allowlisted in malware blocklists, also for reference purposes. **Do not** use this as a blocklist. Still a work in progress.
- wildcard.txt

The domain *and* all subdomains are allowed.
- filter.txt

Specific filters which are known to be problematic.
